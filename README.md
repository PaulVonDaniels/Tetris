# Console Tetris

A simple implementation of the classic Tetris game in C++ for the Windows console. Uses the `windows.h` library to display the game board. Includes seven standard Tetris shapes (O, I, L, J, T, Z, S), each displayed in a unique color. The player controls the falling shapes using the keyboard, and the game ends after a specified number of shapes are placed.
